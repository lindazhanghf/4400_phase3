'More Fun than Scary',
'The villain isn\'t so interesting, apart from her abilities and shortcomings. But the final act is worth the payoff. Maybe not much for the ending. Overall, it\'s a lot of fun than it is scary. For just another trip to the cinema, that\'s all you need to know.',

'I felt that Tarzan in 2016 was a brave move for all involved and they pulled it off perfectly and therefore deserve some credit that has not been given to them by movie reviews. It makes me mad how little recognition this film is getting for being the amazing piece of cinema that it truly is.',

'Bad lead to ending',
'The film fails to keep us engaged. In the last thirty minutes, the film really starts to drag. The action is not as effective and then builds up to the disappointing emotional climax mentioned earlier. At this point, I just wanted our characters to reach safety, or die already. The very last scene however does work well. In a film filled with brutal action, it was nice to end on a heart-warming moment.',

'Family animation with a traditional feel',
'The movie is a very family friendly, warm and fun movie. It has less of the tiresome pop-culture gags in it than some other animated releases, keeping the humour within more traditional themes as say an older Disney movie might do which renders it very suitable for anyone of any age.',

'Most disappointing film I have ever seen?',
'Very little character / plot development and too many borrowed gags. What was the obsession with the soup? How does a janitor afford to build a nuclear reactor? The original cast members should be ashamed of themselves for appearing in this film.',

'I think each character got the chance to shine in this one, which had been lacking in the previous two installments. But comedy wise, I actually think this could be smarter and funnier in its humor to Secret Life Of Pets, which was really funny too- but more sight gags.',

'Every plot twist that wasn\'t blatantly predictable was helpfully telegraphed to make it so; no time was spent (or, I suppose in the creators\' view "wasted") on character development beyond the most absolutely superficial; the acting warranted a disinterested "meh;" and the obvious sequel hook ending was really presumptuous',
